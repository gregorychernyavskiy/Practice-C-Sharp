1. Create a Dictionary<char, int> map = new Dictionary<char, int>(); to count character frequencies in string s.
2. Iterate through each character sch in s. If map.ContainsKey(sch), increment its count; otherwise, add it to the map with a count of 1.
3. Iterate through each character tch in t. If map.ContainsKey(tch), decrement its count. If the count goes below 0, return false immediately.
4. If a character in t is not found in the map, return false as it wasn't in s.
5. If all characters pass the checks, return true â€” meaning s and t are anagrams.
