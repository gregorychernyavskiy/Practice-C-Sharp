1. First, add everything to the map. If the number is zero, just increment the count to keep track of how many zeroes exist.
2. Create another for loop. The first if statement checks if the count of zeroes is greater than 1 — this means the output array will be all zeroes.
3. The second check is if the count is exactly 1 — in this case, only the position of the zero will hold the total product; all other values will be zero.
4. The last check is for when there are no zeroes — set each element in the result array to total / nums[i].
5. Finally, return the result array.
